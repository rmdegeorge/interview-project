# Frontend Interview Project
You have elected to do a take-home project as a part of your interview for a front-end developer position at Canopy. Your goal is to implement a small project in advance of the interview. Part of your interview we will discuss the implementation details of your solution.

***Please DO NOT submit your solution as a pull request to this repository or fork this repository. Doing so lets other candidates see your solution and we have to delete and recreate the repository when this happens.*** Instead, create your own repository from scratch that implements a solution to the problem described here.


## Deck of Cards
Utilizing the [deck of cards API](http://deckofcardsapi.com/), make a network request to "shuffle" or generate a deck of cards. With the returned deck id, make subsequent network requests drawing 2 cards at a time. Keep drawing until each suit's Queen card is drawn. Then stop. Provide separate lists of all cards drawn for each suit. At most make one network request each second.

Your final solution should print to the screen the array of drawn cards for each suit. Each array should be sorted. For example, your code should print something like:

``
SPADES: [2, 3, 5, 10, JACK, QUEEN]
CLUBS: [ACE, 2, 4, 5, 6, 10, JACK, QUEEN, KING]
HEARTS: [2, 3, 5, JACK, QUEEN, KING]
DIAMONDS: [ACE, 2, 3, 5, 6, 7, 8, 10, QUEEN]
