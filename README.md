# My Canopy Interview Project

This app uses the [Deck of Cards API](http://deckofcardsapi.com/) to retreive a shuffled deck of cards when you click the 'Shuffle' button.

You can then draw cards 2 at a time. As you draw cards, they are placed into piles according to suit.

Once, you have drawn all 4 Queens, you stop drawing and sort your piles in ascending order.

You are also limited to only being able to draw cards 1 time per second. I wouldn't want you to accidentally drop the deck and have to play 52 card pickup becuase you tried to play the game too fast!

## To get Started 

### `yarn start`

This will run the dev server on [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).

That's it! Have fun!
